use server to manage simplepeer
if user enters correct password for a roomkey then simplepeer data gets sent to them and they connect
server stores array of:
roomName: {
roomPW (string)
simplePeerIDs (array[string])
chatlog (array[{timestamp (string/int), username (string), message (string)}])
}
creating room: checks if room exists, if it does then doesn't allow
if not: creates room on server with specified info

in this method all data sent between clients through simplepeer, server only connects the clients

browserify simplepeer code?
