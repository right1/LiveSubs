# LiveSubs
Live translated subtitles/chat transcription

Uses a websocket server to connect clients in the same room via simple-peer, allowing 2 languages per room.
Utilises a yandex translate widget to translate all messages sent from the other language in the room.

This implementation currently only works on Chrome (desktop/Android).
